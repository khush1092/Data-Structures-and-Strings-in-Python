## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
This script creates a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values. It allows the user to input a student's name and retrieves their marks if found in the dictionary. If the name is not found, it displays an appropriate message.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
This script demonstrates list slicing by creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracting the first five elements, and reversing them. The extracted and reversed lists are printed as output.
